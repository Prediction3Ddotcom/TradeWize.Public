00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
After you complete all of your onboarding and training videos, you can now search and

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.880
accept available jobs for your role and any roles under you by clicking on the job board icon.

3
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:18.800
By clicking here, you can filter by location, radius, community, start date, lot number, or workers.

4
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.800
Then simply click Apply.

5
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.320
Select any job shown to see the actual location on the map at the top.

6
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.080
You will also notice the start and finish dates shown here.

7
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.420
To accept a job, click on the checkbox next to the lot number and click Register.

8
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.180
You will then be asked to confirm that you want to register for that job.

9
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.019
After clicking Confirm, any accepted jobs will now appear under the My Jobs icon and

10
00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.040
under the Payment icon, but more on that later.

11
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.480
You can accept jobs up to three weeks out and view later dates, but don't worry.

12
00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.120
The system will prevent you from accepting jobs that will create overlapping to ensure quality work.
