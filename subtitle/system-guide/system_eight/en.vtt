The highest role leads, but each has a checklist to complete for payment.

Completing all checklist items ensures a quality job.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.159
finding their name, and scrolling to their checklist.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.519
Help others grow as you'd want them to help you.

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:43.839
If a crew member still doesn't follow their role, once the job is completed you can submit an anonymous score for guided support.

At the end of the job, when all checklist items are completed for all roles, it will prompt a quality inspection.

11
00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:02.239
If passed, all crew members are approved for payment.

12
00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:08.560
If not passed, a notice will show up on the My Jobs icon for all crew members.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:16.400
Any member can click on quality inspection to see the issue, fix the items, and take a photo to show complete.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.120
When all items are complete, the inspector will go back out to approve and then payments will take place.
